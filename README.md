## Create a simple todo list that has the following functionalities:

- You can add a new item to the todo list (required)
- You can remove an item from the todo list (required)
- You can edit an item in the todo list (optional)

### Some further requirements:
- The input field must be reset when the add button is clicked on 
prevent empty values from being added to the list
- The todo list must show the most recently added item first on the list
- The todo list should be stored using localStorage. So, when the page is reloaded, any item in the todo list will still be displayed on the web page.
